# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component provisions a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream and at this time supports CloudWatch to S3 delivery. It enables you to stream logs from EKS CloudWatch to an S3 bucket for long-term storage and analysis.

usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example of how to set up a Firehose stream to capture EKS CloudWatch logs and deliver them to an S3 bucket:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      # First, ensure you have the required dependencies:
      eks/cluster:
        vars:
          name: eks-cluster
          # ... other EKS cluster configuration

      eks/cloudwatch:
        vars:
          name: eks-cloudwatch
          # ... other CloudWatch configuration

      s3-bucket/cloudwatch:
        vars:
          name: cloudwatch-logs-bucket
          # ... other S3 bucket configuration

      # Then configure the Firehose stream:
      kinesis-firehose-stream/basic:
        metadata:
          component: kinesis-firehose-stream
        vars:
          name: cloudwatch-logs
          # Source CloudWatch component name
          source_cloudwatch_component_name: eks/cloudwatch
          # Destination S3 bucket component name
          destination_bucket_component_name: s3-bucket/cloudwatch
          # Optional: Enable encryption for the Firehose stream
          encryption_enabled: true
  ```

  This configuration will:
  1. Create a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream
  2. Configure it to receive logs from the specified EKS CloudWatch component
  3. Deliver the logs to the specified S3 bucket
  4. Optionally enable encryption for the stream
